A combination of machine-learned models that predicts the 
surface elastic properties of general free surfaces in 
face-centered cubic (FCC) metals. These models are built 
by combining a semi-analytical method based on atomistic 
simulations to calculate surface properties with the 
artificial neural network (ANN) or the boosted regression
tree (BRT) method. The latter is also used to link bulk 
properties and surface orientation to surface properties.
The surface elastic properties are represented by their 
invariants considering plane elasticity within a polar method. 
The resulting models are shown to accurately predict the 
surface elastic properties of seven pure FCC metals 
(Cu, Ni, Ag, Au, Al, Pd, Pt). The BRT model reveals the 
correlations between bulk and corresponding surface properties 
in terms of invariants, which can be used to guide the design 
of complex nano-sized particles, wires and films. Finally, 
by expressing the surface excess energy density as a function 
of surface elastic invariants, fast predictions of surface energy 
as a function of in-plane deformations can be made from these 
model constructs.
